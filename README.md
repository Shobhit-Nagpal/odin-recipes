# odin-recipes

This is one of the projects from theodinproject.com where the task was to build a simple recipe website purely out of HTML.

This website contains 3 recipes (Grandma's Lemon Chicken, Cherry Dump Cake, Summer Grilled Pork Chops) that are shown as separate links themselves on the home page.

Once clicked on a link, it will redirect you to the respective recipe you clicked on and give details on what the recipe, what the ingredients required are and the steps to go about making the dishes.

You can check out the simple project here: https://shobhit-nagpal.github.io/odin-recipes/
